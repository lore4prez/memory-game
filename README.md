# memory-game
This is a personal project to practice learning React. A memory card type of game that uses GIPHY API for its images. To win, match the same image until all of the cards have been matched. 

# future plans for improvements
- Add a timer to how long each round takes to complete
- Add multiple levels of difficulty: levels 1 - max n
- Add two modes of playing: singleplayer or two players (maybe multiplayer online using WebSocket)
- Add a database that saves player high scores
- Add sound effects and music
- Add different themes
